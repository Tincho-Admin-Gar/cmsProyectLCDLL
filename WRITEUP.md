# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

#Scalability
Azure App Service provides dynamic scaling out of the box, allowing the application to automatically respond to changes in traffic. This is ideal for web apps that may experience fluctuating demand. In contrast, scaling a Virtual Machine requires manual configuration and monitoring, which can be time-consuming and less responsive.

#Management
App Service simplifies infrastructure management by handling updates, patches, and runtime maintenance automatically. This allows developers to focus on building features rather than maintaining servers. Virtual Machines require full administrative control, which includes managing the OS, updates, and runtime dependencies.

#Cost Efficiency
App Service uses a consumption-based pricing model, which is more cost-effective for applications with variable workloads. It avoids paying for idle resources. Virtual Machines, while flexible, often incur higher costs due to persistent resource allocation and the need for manual oversight.

#User Experience
Deploying to App Service is straightforward, with built-in support for GitHub integration, CI/CD pipelines, and multiple runtime environments. This streamlines the deployment process significantly. Deploying to a VM involves setting up the environment manually, which can be more complex and error-prone.

#Security
App Service includes robust security features such as SSL/TLS support, authentication integration, and compliance with industry standards. Securing a Virtual Machine requires manual configuration of firewalls, certificates, and access controls, which increases the complexity and risk of misconfiguration.

#Conclusion
Considering the benefits in scalability, ease of management, cost savings, deployment simplicity, and built-in security, Azure App Service is the most appropriate choice for deploying this CMS application.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

If the application were to evolve and require more granular control over the operating system, custom software installations, or advanced networking configurations, a Virtual Machine might become the better option. In such cases, the application would need to be adapted to run in a more customizable environment, and the development team would need to manage the full infrastructure stack, including OS-level settings and security protocols.
